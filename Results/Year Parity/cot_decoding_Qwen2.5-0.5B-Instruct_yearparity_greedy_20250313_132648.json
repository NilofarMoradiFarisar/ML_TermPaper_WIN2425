      "full_response": " The answer is that Tom Bateman was born in the 20th century.\nTo explain further, the 20th century spans from 1901 to 2000. In this time period, there are two years with a zero in their names: 1900 and 2000. Since 1901 is an odd number, it falls outside of the range of even and odd numbers. Therefore, Tom Bateman was born in the 20th century, which includes both odd and even years. However, since he was born in 1948, he would be considered an odd-numbered birth year. But if we consider only the odd-numbered years within the 20th century, then his birth year would indeed fall into the category of being an odd year.

He was born on January 15, 1934, which falls within the 20th century. In the 20th century, years are classified as being either even or odd based on their divisibility by 4.

Therefore, any year divisible by 4 (such as 1876) would be considered an even year, while any year not divisible by 4 (like 1875) would be considered an odd year. Since 1934 is divisible by 4, it would fall into the \"even\" category of years. However, it's important to note that Samuel Blenkin was also born in the United",
